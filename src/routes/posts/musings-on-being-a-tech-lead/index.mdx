# Some musings on being a tech lead<a name="musings"></a>

I was recently asked words to the effect of “you’ve been a tech lead on project X before, have any advice?” I gave some thoughts on what advice I thought would be helpful but this is a reflection on some of the themes that were prevalent. In this context I’m talking about the tech lead role where a person is leading a team and not acting independently, while I’ve enjoyed doing the latter at points this is about the former.

## **It’s all about people, one way or another.**<a name="people"></a>

What I found myself primarily talking about was people, often if people have become tech leads / are being considered for that it’s not really the technical skills from experience I think people need advice on. Sadly many strong technical people end up in a tech lead role to only find that the skills that got them there are not necessarily the only ones they need to thrive in that role. Instead it’s about enabling, facilitating and leading a team. In that it’s all about people in my mind, albeit in a technical context.

### Look to create an environment where others thrive.<a name="servant-leadership"></a>

Personally I’m a big believer that the most effective form of leadership is [servant leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership), that by having my primary focus on looking to help others thrive creates the environment where people can do their best work. A team that is able to thrive will always outperform an individual in my opinion and in my mind a tech lead can influence / shape that.

### The more you can understand people the more you can help<a name="understanding-people"></a>

If the goal is to have an environment where individuals can thrive, then you need (or at least attempt) to understand what brings out the best (and worst) in people. Being able to empathise with others, the ability to understand and “imagine” how another person may feel or think about a situation, is a very important skill here. It gives you the information needed to be proactive in creating an environment where people can flourish and work on resolving items that would otherwise be detrimental. Practical examples ranges hugely, from side of desk activity, one to ones and thinking about how work may be best divided up and discussing those thoughts with the team.

### Being able to persuade / influence at the right level<a name="influence"></a>

This is a crucial skill in my mind, being able to persuade and influence can have a hugely positive impact when directed for good. It can change the course of an otherwise sinking ship, making possible small positive incremental changes that otherwise would be ruled out by explaining the merit. Yet the devil in the detail here is understanding that for different stakeholders what their motives are, I’ve seen times where engineers want to talk about the benefit of making code “more maintainable” to stakeholders who in lots of ways really do not care about whether code is maintainable or not - they want a functioning stable system. It sounds obvious but being able to translate the benefits of engineering decisions in relation to stakeholder incentives and convey that is hugely valuable.

## Understanding what value is in your context, balancing the bigger picture.<a name="context"></a>

This is another area where some people making the transition to being a tech lead struggle, balancing the bigger picture with the detail of the day to day in relation to what is considered valuable in the domain. This is an area that I have a lot of sympathy for when people do struggle, for a person who has been praised by their attention to detail to all of a sudden being expected to understand the bigger picture in addition to the detail doesn’t always come naturally. On top of being responsible for a team can be overwhelming. Some of the key responsibilities in this area for me are trying to think about the details that have otherwise been missed, understanding the dependencies between teams / deliverables and questioning whether alternatives exist that would be more valuable.

<hr />
On further reflection two key points that I don’t think I mentioned but worth consider
worthy of calling out separately are:

## Take a **risk first** approach<a name="risk-first"></a>

Risk first is a hugely important value that I’ve developed from my time at BJSS. It’s something that I’m very thankful to have learned from others who have seen the benefit of doing so. In that sense an important skill for a tech lead is to understand or figure out for a given piece of work where the risk lies in my opinion. Being able to identify and communicate where the risk lies allows for the associated piece of work to tackle that issue head on rather than allowing it to become a blocker at the last moment. From a business perspective it allows re-evaluation of whether to continue or not spending time investing in a direction with check points about whether a change of course is needed.

## **Understanding how to do incremental migrations / changes and being okay with the mess inbetween**<a name="incremental-change"></a>

Greenfield projects are the dream for most developers while in reality very few projects are that. Often people end up working on codebases that get referred to as “legacy” where “tech debt” is abundant. [Stop saying technical debt](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/02/27/stop-saying-technical-debt/) is an excellent article that I’d highly recommend when it comes to advocating rephrasing “tech debt” as “maintenance load”. The point I want to call out when it comes to maintenance load, knowing how to get from a state where an issue causing maintenance load to it being resolved in an incremental fashion is incredibly valuable. One temptation is to try and tackle an issue head on, adovcating for spending days, weeks or even more depending on the issue to say “we’ll never have to deal with it again” by the end. There are some cases where that truly does need to happen but arguably not as often as advocated for. Instead being able to create a path where improvements to resolve an issue can be made as part of daily work allows for items that would otherwise not get the attention needed is very valuable. A counter argument to small changes like this is along the lines of “well it’s still doesn’t resolve the issue today does it?” No, _but it allows for an issue to be resolved over time_. While it would be nice to resolve issues like this sooner, it’s better than never without the risk of it being wasted effort.

## Conclusion<a name="conlcusion"></a>

I thoroughly enjoy being a tech lead, I enjoy getting to solve the difficult technical issues with a team, being mindful of the bigger picture and getting to deliver change (features or otherwise) that are valuable in the context that I am. Yet my experience has been the way I’ve had the greatest impact as a tech lead is by attempting to create an environment that enables others to do the best they can, tackles risks head on and by trying to set culture ultimately.
