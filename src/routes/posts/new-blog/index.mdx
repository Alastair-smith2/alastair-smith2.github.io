# So why a new blog?

Mainly because I've wanted a space for a long time that I can put down some thoughts
and occasionally cross share. Writing up about a topic is a great way to learn it.

## What is this built with?

The following:

1. [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/), looks really promising, specifically [resumability](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/concepts/resumable/) could truly change the JS dicussion but time will tell.
2. [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) (I hadn't been intending to learn this, but I needed a css framework. I had seen people comment above how much they like Tailwind and I can see why!)
3. [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a nice way to host for free.

We'll see what else pops up on this space.
