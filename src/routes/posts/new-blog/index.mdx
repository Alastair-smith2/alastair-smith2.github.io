# So why a blog?

Mainly because I've wanted a space for a long time that I can put down some thoughts
and occasionally cross share. Writing up about a topic is a great way to learn it.

## What is this built with?

I wanted to use this as an opportunity to use some technology that I'd heard about, primarily the following:

1. [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/), which looks really promising in general. Specifically [resumability](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/concepts/resumable/) could truly change the JS dicussion but time will tell as there's a lot going on in the community at the moment.
2. [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), I hadn't intended to learn this, but I needed a CSS framework. I have seen people comment above how much they like Tailwind and now see why.
3. [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), I'd normally default to cypress for E2E testing in JS / TS but again had heard good things and given the recent announcement of [page.getBy\*](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.27.0) I thought I'd give a whirl.
4. [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a convenient way to host for free.

Admittedly stuff like CI / CD is missng but at least husky is running lint + E2E locally before the deploy command is being run.

We'll see what else pops up on this space.
