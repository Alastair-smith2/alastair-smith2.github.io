# A new blog

1. [So why a blog?](#why)
2. [What is this built with?](#technology)

## So why a blog?<a name="why"></a>

Mainly because I've wanted a space for a while that I can put down some thoughts
and occasionally cross share. Writing up about a topic is a great way to learn it.

## What is this built with?<a name="technology"></a>

I wanted this to be an opportunity to use some technology that I've heard about and see what they were like for the most part. For those who are interested; it includes the following:

1. <ArticleLink href="https://qwik.builder.io/" text="Qwik" />, specifically <ArticleLink
     href="https://www.builder.io/blog/resumability-from-ground-up"
     text="resumability"
   /> caught my attention and I'm intrigued to see how Qwik develops. A <ArticleLink
     href="https://www.builder.io/blog/qwik-rc-milestone"
     text="1.0 RC"
   /> was announced yesterday but time will tell as there's a lot going on in
   the community (e.g. Remix, RSC, Astro, Deno, Bun and the many others that
   I've not listed here) at the moment. While the innovation is promising;
   trying to keep up to date with everything can fatiguing.{" "}
2. <ArticleLink href="https://tailwindcss.com/" text="Tailwind" />, I hadn't
   intended to learn this, but I needed a CSS framework. I have seen people
   comment above how much they like Tailwind and now see why.
3. <ArticleLink href="https://playwright.dev/" text="Playwright" />, I'd
   normally default to cypress for E2E testing in JS / TS but again had heard
   good things and given the recent announcement of <ArticleLink
     href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.27.0"
     text="page.getBy\*"
   />
   I thought I'd give a whirl. Getting
   <ArticleLink
     href="https://playwright.dev/docs/accessibility-testing"
     text="axe-core"
   /> integrated for _some_ automated accessibility testing was straight forward
   as well.
4. <ArticleLink href="https://pages.github.com/" text="Github pages" />, is a
   convenient way to host for free.

It's been nice to be able to leverage <ArticleLink href="https://github.com/features/actions" text="Github actions" /> to automate the build and deploy process.

We'll see what else pops up on this space.
