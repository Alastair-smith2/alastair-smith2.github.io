Yet the devil in the detail here is understanding that for different stakeholders what their motives are, I’ve seen times where engineers want to talk about the benefit of making code “more maintainable” to stakeholders who in lots of ways really do not care about whether code is maintainable or not - they want a functioning stable system.

Being able to identify and communicate where the risk lies allows for the associated piece of work to tackle that issue head on rather than allowing it to become a blocker at the last moment.

The point I want to call out when it comes to maintenance load, knowing how to get from a state where an issue causing maintenance load to it being resolved in an incremental fashion is incredibly valuable. One temptation is to try and tackle an issue head on, adovcating for spending days, weeks or even more depending on the issue to say “we’ll never have to deal with it again” by the end. There are some cases where that truly does need to happen but arguably not as often as advocated for. Instead being able to create a path where improvements to resolve an issue can be made as part of daily work allows for items that would otherwise not get the attention needed is very valuable. A counter argument to small changes like this is along the lines of “well it’s still doesn’t resolve the issue today does it?” No, ",e(t.em,{children:"but it allows for an issue to be resolved over time"}),".
