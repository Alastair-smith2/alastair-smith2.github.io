When any of these are in short supply a flicker of a thought can go by. “What if we had the time to not rush this?” “What if we were able to change the scope?” “What if we had more money?” These thoughts sound so tantalising. The idea that if there was less pressure or ideally no pressure then a more robust and quality system would be the result of a project delivery."]}),e(i.p,{children:"It’s an illusion though; the so called “dream” of having no pressure. Or at least that’s the conclusion I’ve come to. I’ve had a couple of experiences where in essence there was almost no delivery pressure for what was being worked on. Delivering changes mainly existed in the context of “it’ll take as long as it takes and that’s okay”. This baffled me at first while simultaneously feeling like fresh air. Having signfincantly less pressure contrasted so starkly to the majority of other experiences I’ve had. It felt like an opportunity to deliver work to the ideal standard."}),e(i.p,{children:["Over time however this perception changed. Don’t get me wrong - the team I was a part of delivered some excellent improvements during one of those periods which became the basis for a capability that had long been hoped for. Something was missing however. Upon reflection delivery pressure often is excellent at creating one thing which is hard to conjure up. Being laser-focused on what is most important. The team I was a part of still wanted to deliver value at speed but the check we had all become acustom to was absent. There was no external factor, besides ourselves, to ask “is this really that important in light of X, Y or Z?” An important distinction was also what factors were important to ",e(i.strong,{children:e(i.em,{children:"who"})}),"? The team all held beliefs around what code quality should look like but at what point are we being nit-picky in relation to the bigger picture?

It excellently lays out how people often function
within complex systems. A system in this context is an interconnected set of elements
where a mechanism(s) of feedback causes some behaviour(s) to either increase or decrease.
With this lens an interesting question to ask about pressure is what behaviour does
it reward or discourage. Pressure which incenticises meeting short term deadlines
is unsurprisingly likely to cause individuals and teams to adjust their attention
towards immediate goals, because they know that is how they will be judged. However
this can come at a cost to the bigger picture. Obviously there are many other dynamics
which can exist but a key point is that over a project lifetime it’s often end users
who lose out as project members are trying to balance the pressure they experience
and their own incentives.`]}),e(i.p,{children:"Pressure doesn’t always have to work out in this manner however. Pressure, intentionally directed and shaped, can bring clarity to individuals and teams - this is my belief. Pressure can create a context which helps people understand what is most important to the users of the serivce they’re delivering. Pressure can create a feedback loop of rewarding the desired behaviour and being a course correction mechanism for undesirable behaviour. At the heart of this is creating an environment where accurate information is available to make informed decisions which people receive the appropriate feedback. Pressure in this context can be a multiplier to aligning people to the desired behaviour. What I’ve described here I don’t think is trivial to create, especially given some of the current economic challenges organisations face, but it is possible."}),e(i.h2,{id:"conclusion",children:[e(i.a,{"aria-hidden":"true",tabindex:"-1",href:"#conclusion",children:e(i.span,{class:"icon icon-link"})}),"Conclusion",e("a",{name:"conclusion"})]}),e(i.p,{children:"In many ways these thoughts really just scratch the surface of a much more complicated topic than I can do justice in a post. “Pressure creates diamonds.” It certainly can do, but rarely is it that simple. Ideally leaders involved in delivering software projects think about pressure from a feedback loop perspective rather than a deadline perspective. Not because a deadline doesn’t matter but because the next one, and the culture which is being shaped within this context, does as well."})]})}const u=()=>{const t=r({});return typeof MDXLayout=="function"?e(MDXLayout,{children:t}):t};export{u as default,d as frontmatter,c as head,l as headings};
