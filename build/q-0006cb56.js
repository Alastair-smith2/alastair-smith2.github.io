of times point P was "dotted" on a curve. Before explaining what "dotted" means, a
key piece of information is this: for two given points on a curve (e.g. our starting
points A and B, which will both be on one side of the x-axis) there will always be at most a third point. What this means is for our
starting point we can find the third point - C - on the curve, by drawing a straight
line through A and B. Once we’ve found where this line intercepts on the curve, we
find the corresponding point of the curve on the other side of the x-axis and this
becomes C. Now we repeat the process using A and C as our two points to find where
the next part of the graph is intercepted and flip over the x-axis again to find D. If you’d like

how many times we "dotted" the starting point P. Finding n from E and P is incredibly
difficult but finding E from n and P is simple for computers. This problem is known
as the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) and is a form of the discrete
